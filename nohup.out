  Parameters: {"text"=>"A blue Hawaii is typically served on the rocks. As with most tropical drinks, there are many variations in preparation, presentation, and ingredients. Hence, it is often blended with ice, margarita-like, to be served as a frozen cocktail. Many variations of glassware are used, the more whimsical the better: tiki mugs, cocktail glasses, parfait glasses, or carved out coconuts or pineapples. "}

  Parameters: {"text"=>"The base liquor is usually light rum but vodka may be partially or completely substituted as a matter of taste. Similarly, a flavored rum or vodka such as Malibu Rum may eliminate the need for crème of coconut, or the coconut flavor may be omitted entirely (coconut milk, a very different product, should  not  be used). Even the pineapple juice is sometimes left out in favor of sour mix. The only constant, in fact, is the name and the blue Curaçao. "}

  Parameters: {"text"=>"Because it is easy and inexpensive to make, it is often served as a punch. At its simplest, it is a bottle or two of plain or coconut-flavored light rum, a bottle of blue curacao, a can of pineapple juice, and a bag of ice, mixed together in a punchbowl. The Blue Hawaii is seasonal, often considered a summer or warm weather drink.

At the time that  Brass Monkey  was released, liquor stores carried mostly beer, wine, and hard alcohol; there were very few premixed alternatives. The drink was named by Steve Doniger, an advertising executive, after an alleged World War II spy, named H. E. Rasske. Sales and popularity of Heublein's \"Brass Monkey\" increased in the 1980s after the release of the Beastie Boys song with the same title as the beverage. "}

It was Yee who named the drink which, along with the films and songs, many other tropical drinks he invented, and tiki bars such as Trader Vic, did much to popularize a faux Hawaiian tiki culture, both in Hawaii itself and on the Mainland. The era was immediately pre-statehood, a time when Hawaii was thought of by most Americans as playground for the rich. Tourism and development was already significant, but all centered around Waikiki and at only a small fraction of today's levels – about 100,000 visitors per year then, compared to seven million today. \r\n   Preparation and variations  "}

At its simplest, it is a bottle or two of plain or coconut-flavored light rum, a bottle of blue curacao, a can of pineapple juice, and a bag of ice, mixed together in a punchbowl. The Blue Hawaii is seasonal, often considered a summer or warm weather drink. Occasionally, because it contains yellow pineapple juice, the Blue Hawaii will be a lovely shade of green. \r\n   \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   "}

  Parameters: {"text"=>"The Blue Hawaii was invented in 1957 by Harry Yee, legendary head bartender of the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki, Hawaii when a sales representative of Dutch distiller Bols asked him to design a drink that featured their blue color of Curaçao liqueur. After experimenting with several variations he settled on a version somewhat different than the most popular version today, but with the signature blue color, pineapple wedge, and cocktail umbrella.

  Parameters: {"text"=>"The name \"Blue Hawaii\" is related only indirectly to the 1961 Elvis Presley film of the same name, and apparently derives instead from the film's title song, a hit composed by Leo Robin for the 1937 Bing Crosby film  Waikiki Wedding . It was Yee who named the drink which, along with the films and songs, many other tropical drinks he invented, and tiki bars such as Trader Vic, did much to popularize a faux Hawaiian tiki culture, both in Hawaii itself and on the Mainland. The era was immediately pre-statehood, a time when Hawaii was thought of by most Americans as playground for the rich. Tourism and development was already significant, but all centered around Waikiki and at only a small fraction of today's levels – about 100,000 visitors per year then, compared to seven million today. \r\n   Preparation and variations  "}
